# Custom-GPT-Guide : 
**The Architect's Guide: Crafting Custom AI with GPT Builder**
A comprehensive guide to crafting custom AI with GPT Builder and insights into GPT Architect.

# Custom GPT Guide Development

##  Project Overview
Welcome to the "Custom GPT Guide Development" project! This initiative is dedicated to creating "The Architect's Guide: Crafting Custom AI with GPT Builder," a comprehensive manual for individuals and organizations interested in developing custom AI models using the GPT Builder tool. This guide aims to demystify the process of AI model customization, making it accessible to a wide range of users, from beginners in AI to seasoned data scientists.

## Objectives
Educate: Provide a thorough understanding of Large Language Models (LLM), GPT models, and the GPT Builder tool.
Guide: Offer step-by-step instructions and best practices for creating custom GPT models using GPT Builder.
Inspire: Showcase real-world applications and success stories to illustrate the potential of custom AI models.
Engage: Create a collaborative space for learning, sharing, and enhancing the knowledge surrounding GPT technology.
